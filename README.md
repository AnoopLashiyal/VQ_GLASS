# Data Reconstruction Attack: Latent Space Search (Rebranded GLASS)

## Overview
This repository implements a **Data Reconstruction Attack** using **latent space search** techniques.  
It is essentially a rebranding of **GLASS (GAN-based LAtent Space Search)**, where we aim to reconstruct private input data by optimizing in the generator's latent space.

The attack leverages a pretrained **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) Generator** along with auxiliary models to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions from intermediate representations.

## Setup

### 1. Install Required Libraries
Make sure to install all necessary Python libraries. You can do so by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, manually install libraries as indicated in the code.

### 2. Download Checkpoints
You need to download the pretrained checkpoints for:
- WGAN Generator
- Client/Server models
- Auxiliary models (if applicable)

ðŸ‘‰ **Checkpoints can be downloaded from:**

## Usage

After setting up the environment and downloading the checkpoints:

Run the main script to start the reconstruction attack:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can also specify options manually:
```bash
python main.py --use_pretrained True --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoints
```

## Notes
- This project rebrands and extends the concepts introduced in GLASS, adapting them with improvements in latent optimization techniques.
- Make sure checkpoint paths are correctly specified either in the configuration files or as command-line arguments.
- Reconstruction quality depends on the fidelity of the generator and the structure of the intermediate representations.
